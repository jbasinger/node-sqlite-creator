# NAME

node-sqlite-creator - An easy way to create tables in sqlite

Writing hardcoded sql stinks. Let's not do that anymore. Why write in two languages when you can
stick to one. Let's not complicate things. This library was created to allow you to create tables
in sqlite using js instead of having to write sql.

# IMPORTANT NOTE

This library is based off of https://github.com/orlandov/node-sqlite

# USAGE

Check out the create_table_test.js to see how things are done. You can output the sql as text or
run it directly. I will make this actually have examples eventually. For now check out that file.
